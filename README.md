### üìÇ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **[DCR-Books](https://dcrbooks.netlify.app/)**  
  **DCR Books** is a user-friendly book tracking app designed to help avid readers manage and track their reading journey. With **React Query** and **Axios** powering seamless API interactions, users can search for books through the **Google Books API**, add books they've read, and mark favorites for easy access.

  The interface is built with **Material-UI (MUI)**, providing a clean and responsive design, while **React-Hot-Toaster** offers intuitive feedback on actions like adding or removing books. This app also leverages the **Context API** for efficient state management, making it a streamlined tool for readers looking to keep their reading list organized and accessible.

- **[FlexxCart](https://flexxcart.netlify.app/)**  
  **FlexxCart** is a modern, intuitive e-commerce application designed to enhance the online shopping experience. Built with **React** and **Redux** for efficient state management, FlexxCart allows users to browse products by category, add items to their cart, and manage their orders seamlessly.

  Due to API limitations, custom logic is implemented to handle additional features, creating a more robust shopping experience and better control over product data. This app integrates **Axios** for API requests, provides real-time product information, and uses **React Query** for optimized data fetching. With a responsive and visually appealing interface designed using **Material-UI (MUI)**, FlexxCart offers a smooth shopping experience across all devices. i used Fakestore API for this Project.

- **[Recito](https://recito.netlify.app/)**  
**Recito** is a simple yet powerful recipe finder and uploader application, built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Sass**. Users can search for recipes, upload their own, and bookmark their favorite recipes for easy access later. The project is structured using the **MVC architecture** for better organization and scalability, while following the **BEM methodology** for clean and maintainable CSS. This project showcases advanced **DOM manipulation** techniques, allowing seamless interaction with the UI without the use of any JavaScript frameworks.  
The **UI** is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, providing a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
